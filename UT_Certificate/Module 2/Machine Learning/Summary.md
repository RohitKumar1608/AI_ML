Q.1 Difference between Machine Learning and Statistics?

Data -> Divided into -> Training Set and Testing Set

**Correlaton** :- 
- Is the statstical measure that describe the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables.
- ranges between -1(Perfect negative Correlation) and 1(Perfect Positive correlation). 0(No Correlation between Variables)

**Pearson Correlation Coffiecient :-**
- Statistical measure that quantifies the strength and direction of a relationship between two continous variables.

Correlation Formula :-

Correlation vs causation?
Correlation and Causation are not same. If Variable 1 and Variable 2 are highly correlated that doesn't mean that variable 1 causes a change in variable 2.

Q. Correlation is unitless ?
Answer :- Yes, correlation is unitless. This is because the correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables and is derived from their standardized values.
Why is Correlation Unitless?
1. Standardization:
    * Correlation is calculated using the covariance of two variables, divided by the product of their standard deviations:
       r=Cov(X,Y)/σX σY
