**MEAN :-**

Mean is the sum of all the values in the data set divided by the number of values in the data set. It is also called the Arithmetic Average. Mean is denoted as x̅ and is read as x bar.

The formula to calculate the mean is(x̅): Sum of values/ Number of values. 

If x1, x2, x3,……, xn are the values of a data set then the mean is calculated as:

x̅ =  (x1 + x2 + x3 + . . . + xn) / n

Ex:- Mean of the data 10, 30, 40, 20, 50 is

Mean = (sum of all values) / (number of values)

Mean = (10 + 30 + 40 + 20+ 50) / 5 = 30

**MEDIAN :-**

A Median is a middle value for sorted data. The sorting of the data can be done either in ascending order or descending order. A median divides the data into two equal halves. 

The formula to calculate the median of the number of terms if the number of terms is even is shown in the image below:

If n=even

Median = [(n/2)th Term +(n/2)+1 th Term]/2

If n=odd
Median= [(n+1)/2]th Term

Median of the data 30, 40, 10, 20, 50 is,


**Step 1**: Order the given data in ascending order as:


10, 20, 30, 40, 50


**Step 2**: Check n (number of terms of data set) is even or odd and find the median of the data with respective ‘n’ value.


**Step 3**: Here, n = 5 (odd)


Median = [(n + 1)/2]th term


Median = [(5 + 1)/2]th term

= 30

**Median of Grouped Data**
The median of the grouped data median is calculated using the formula,


**Median = l + [(n/2 – cf) / f]×h**


where

l is lower limit of median class
n is number of observations
f is frequency of median class
h is class size
cf is cumulative frequency of class preceding the median class.

**MODE**

A mode is the most frequent value or item of the data set. A data set can generally have one or more than one mode value. If the data set has one mode then it is called **“Uni-modal”**. Similarly, If the data set contains 2 modes then it is called **“Bimodal”** and if the data set contains 3 modes then it is known as **“Trimodal”**. If the data set consists of more than one mode then it is known as **“multi-modal”(can be bimodal or trimodal)**. There is no mode for a data set if every number appears only once.
