Mean :- 
Mean is the sum of all the values in the data set divided by the number of values in the data set. It is also called the Arithmetic Average. Mean is denoted as x̅ and is read as x bar.

The formula to calculate the mean is(x̅): Sum of values/ Number of values 
 If x1, x2, x3,……, xn are the values of a data set then the mean is calculated as:
x̅ =  (x1 + x2 + x3 + . . . + xn) / n
Ex:- Mean of the data 10, 30, 40, 20, 50 is
Mean = (sum of all values) / (number of values)
Mean = (10 + 30 + 40 + 20+ 50) / 5 = 30
