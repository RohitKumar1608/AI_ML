**MEAN :-**

Mean is the sum of all the values in the data set divided by the number of values in the data set. It is also called the Arithmetic Average. Mean is denoted as x̅ and is read as x bar.

The formula to calculate the mean is(x̅): Sum of values/ Number of values. 

If x1, x2, x3,……, xn are the values of a data set then the mean is calculated as:

x̅ =  (x1 + x2 + x3 + . . . + xn) / n

Ex:- Mean of the data 10, 30, 40, 20, 50 is

Mean = (sum of all values) / (number of values)

Mean = (10 + 30 + 40 + 20+ 50) / 5 = 30

**MEDIAN :-**

A Median is a middle value for sorted data. The sorting of the data can be done either in ascending order or descending order. A median divides the data into two equal halves. 

The formula to calculate the median of the number of terms if the number of terms is even is shown in the image below:

If n=even

Median = [(n/2)th Term +(n/2)+1 th Term]/2

If n=odd
Median= [(n+1)/2]th Term

Median of the data 30, 40, 10, 20, 50 is,


**Step 1**: Order the given data in ascending order as:


10, 20, 30, 40, 50


**Step 2**: Check n (number of terms of data set) is even or odd and find the median of the data with respective ‘n’ value.


**Step 3**: Here, n = 5 (odd)


Median = [(n + 1)/2]th term


Median = [(5 + 1)/2]th term


            = 30
