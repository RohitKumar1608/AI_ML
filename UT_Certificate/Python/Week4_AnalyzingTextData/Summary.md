**Structured and Unstructured Data**

1. **Structured Data** :-
     - standardized format for efficient access by software and humans alike
     - It is typically tabular with rows and columns that clearly define data attributes.**For example**, a structured customer data table 
       containing columns—name, address, and phone number—can provide insights like the total number of customers and the locality with the 
       maximum number of customers. In contrast, unstructured data, like a list of social media posts, is more challenging to analyze.
     
     **Feature of Structured Data**
      - Definable Attributes :- Structured data has the same attributes for all data values.  For example, every booking record could have 
        these attributes: booking name, event name, event date, and booking amount.
      - Relational attributes :- Structured data tables have common values that link different datasets together. For example, you can 
        relate customer data with booking data by using customer id and booking id fields. So, data can be stored conveniently in 
        a relational database.
      - Quantitative data :- 
      - Storage :- You can store structured data in relational databases and manage it using structured query language (SQL). SQL lets you           define a data model called a schema under which you determine preset rules—such as fields, formats, and values—for your data. You            can then store structured data in data warehouses or other relational database technology.
